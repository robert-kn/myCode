we (and the machines we have built to do work) generate a lot of data. this data requires analysis, manipulation and management if we
are to derive value from it. this is why jobs in the data ecosystem were created and continue to grow.

whichever way you refer to data, data centric world or data is the new oil, the large amount of data that is being generated needs vast 
repositories for storage.

SQL is a utility that was created to help with querying, updating and manipulating of structured data stored in repositories. 

SQL constructs can also be executed from within various programming languages; perhaps the most popular language that it is used with 
is python because it is a simple language.

what is data? a collection of facts that can include words, numbers or pictures. it is one of the most critical assets of any business. 
since it is critical to businesses it needs to be securely stored. this is where databases come into play.

a database is a program that stores data (a repository of data). there are different types of databases, they include - relational 
databases (data stored in tabular form), nosql etc.

what about database management systems? they are a set of software utilities that help in the management of data stored in a database. 
this management includes access, organisation, and storage. the terms database, database server, database system, data server, and DBMS 
are often used interchangeably.

in the case of relational databases, their DBMS are referred to as RDBMS. examples of RDBMS include MySQL, Oracle database, IBM Db2, MS 
SQL Server, Postgresql etc.

the select statement is a DML statement.

what is a DML statement? used to read and modify data.

the output from a DML statement is called a result set or a result table.

you can restrict the result set returned by using the WHERE clause.

a full list of comparison operators supported by a RDBMS: = > < >= <= <> (not equal to)

count is a built in database function that returns the number of rows that match a criteria.

the distinct built in function removes duplicate values from a result set.

the limit built in function restricts the number of rows retrieved from a table.

insert statement is used to add new rows to a table. it is a DML statement. see insert1.png and insert2.png

the update statement is used to alter the rows of a table that is already populated. it is a DML statement see update1

delete statement is a DML statement see delete.png
