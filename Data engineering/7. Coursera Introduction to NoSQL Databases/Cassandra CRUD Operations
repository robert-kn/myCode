Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

Insert data into a table with an INSERT command
Read data from a table by querying from it
Update and delete data from the table based on specific criteria

Getting the environment ready

Create a keyspace named training using SimpleStrategy and replication factor of 3.

CREATE KEYSPACE training WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3};

Create a table named movies with columns ‘movie_id’ which is the primary key and integer type, ‘movie_name’ of type text, and ‘year_of_release’ of type integer.

use training;
CREATE TABLE movies(
movie_id int PRIMARY KEY,
movie_name text,
year_of_release int
);

Insert data into a table

Let us insert a row into the table movies.

On cqlsh run the below command.

INSERT into movies(
movie_id, movie_name, year_of_release)
VALUES (1,'Toy Story',1995);

Verify that the data is saved.

select * from movies;

Insert the below movies into the table.

movie_id	movie_name	year_of_release
2	           Jumanji	    1995
3	            Heat	    1995
4	           Scream	    1995
5	            Fargo	    1996

INSERT into movies(
movie_id, movie_name, year_of_release)
VALUES (2,'Jumanji',1995);

INSERT into movies(
movie_id, movie_name, year_of_release)
VALUES (3,'Heat',1995);

INSERT into movies(
movie_id, movie_name, year_of_release)
VALUES (4,'Scream',1995);

INSERT into movies(
movie_id, movie_name, year_of_release)
VALUES (5,'Fargo',1996);

Read data from a table

In the previous exercise you have inserted some data into the table named movies.
Let us query the data in the movies table.

Query all rows.

select * from movies;

Query the movie name with movie_id 1.

select movie_name from movies where movie_id = 1;

Update data in a table

The movie_id for Scream is 4. It was released in 1996 and not 1995. Here is how you modify it.

UPDATE movies
SET year_of_release = 1996
WHERE movie_id = 4;

Verify that the update was successful.

select * from movies where movie_id = 4;

Delete data from a table

Delete the movie with the movie_id 5.

DELETE from movies
WHERE movie_id = 5;

Verify using the below command.

select * from movies;
