The filter command cut helps us extract selected characters or fields from a line of text.

echo "database" | cut -c1-4 --> data

echo "database" | cut -c5-8 --> base

echo "database" | cut -c1,5 --> db

Extracting fields/columns. We can extract a specific column/field from a delimited text file, by mentioning
1. the delimiter using the -d option, or
2. the field number using the -f option.

cut -d":" -f1 /etc/passwd --> The command extracts usernames (the first field) from /etc/passwd.

cut -d":" -f1,3,6 /etc/passwd --> The command extracts multiple fields 1st, 3rd, and 6th (username, userid, and home directory) from /etc/passwd.

cut -d":" -f3-6 /etc/passwd  --> The command extracts a range of fields 3rd to 6th (userid, groupid, user description and home directory) from /etc/passwd.

tr is a filter command used to translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters.

Translate from one character set to another

echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"  --> The command translates all lower case alphabets to upper case.

echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" --> You could also use the pre-defined character sets also for this purpose:

echo "Shell Scripting" | tr  "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"  --> The command translates all upper case alphabets to lower case.

Squeeze repeating occurrences of characters. The -s option replaces a sequence of a repeated characters with a single occurrence of that character.

ps | tr -s " "  --> The command replaces repeat occurrences of ‘space’ in the output of ps command with one ‘space’.

In the above example, the space character within quotes can be replaced with the following : "[\:space\:]".

Delete characters. We can delete specified characters using the -d  option.

echo "My login pin is 5634" | tr -d "[:digit:]" --> The command deletes all digits.
