Submitting a DAG is as simple as copying the DAG Python file into the dags folder in the 
AIRFLOW_HOME directory.

Airflow searches for Python source files within the specified DAGS_FOLDER. The location of 
DAGS_FOLDER can be located in the airflow.cfg file, where it has been configured as 
/home/project/airflow/dags.


Airflow will load the Python source files from this designated location. It will process 
each file, execute its contents, and subsequently load any DAG objects present in the file.

Therefore, when submitting a DAG, it is essential to position it within this directory 
structure. Alternatively, the AIRFLOW_HOME directory, representing the structure 
/home/project/airflow, can also be utilized for DAG submission.
