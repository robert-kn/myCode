Create a topic

Open a new terminal and cd into the extracted kafka directory

bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic [topic_name] --bootstrap-server localhost:9092       


Create the producer

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh   --bootstrap-server localhost:9092   --topic [topic_name]  (You need a producer to send messages to Kafka. Run the command to start a producer.)

(After the producer starts, and you get the '>' prompt, type any text message and press enter. The messages to Kafka will be sent to the kafka topic.)


Create the consumer

Open a new terminal and cd into the extracted kafka directory

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh   --bootstrap-server localhost:9092   --topic [topic_name]   --from-beginning (Run the command to listen to the messages in the topic news)

You should see all the messages you sent from the producer appear here.

You can go back to the producer terminal and type some more messages, one message per line, and you will see them appear here.

Kafka uses the tmp/kraft-combined-logs directory to store the messages. it should be in the unzipped kafka directory
