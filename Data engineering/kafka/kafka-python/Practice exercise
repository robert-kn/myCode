Create a new producer from bankbranch in a file named new_producer.py which will take user input as long as the user wants and accept user input for the ATM number they want to transact with (1 or 2) and stream the transaction.

Observe the consumer getting the events streamed by the producer in real time.

import json
producer = KafkaProducer(value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))
transid = 102
while True:
        user_input = input("Do you want to add a transaction? (press 'n' to stop): ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'n':
            print("Stopping the transactions")
            break
        else:
            atm_choice = input("Which ATM you want to transact in? 1 or 2 ")
            if (atm_choice == '1' or atm_choice == '2'):
                producer.send("bankbranch", {'atmid':int(atm_choice), 'transid':transid})
