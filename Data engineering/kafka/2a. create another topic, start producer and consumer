Create a topic and producer for processing bank ATM transactions


Next, you will create a bankbranch topic to process messages from bank branch ATM machines.

Suppose the messages come from the ATM in the form of a simple JSON object, including an ATM ID and a transaction ID like the following example:

{"atmid": 1, "transid": 100}

To process the ATM messages, you will first need to create a new topic called bankbranch.

Open a new terminal and cd into the extracted kafka directory

Create a new topic using the --topic argument with the name bankbranch. To simplify the topic configuration 
and better explain how message key and consumer offset work, you specify the --partitions 2 argument to 
create two partitions for this topic. To compare the differences, you may try other partitions settings for 
this topic.

bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic bankbranch --partitions 2 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

List all topics to check if bankbranch has been created successfully.

bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

You can also use the --describe command to check the details of the topic bankbranch.

bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic bankbranch

You can view the bankbranch as two partitions, Partition 0 and Partition 1. If no message keys are specified, 
messages will be published to these two partitions in an alternating sequence like this:  

Partition 0 -> Partition 1 -> Partition 0 -> Partition 1 …

Next, you can create a producer to publish ATM transaction messages.

Run the following command in the same terminal window with the topic details to create a producer for the topic bankbranch.

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh   --bootstrap-server localhost:9092   --topic bankbranch  (You need a producer to send messages to Kafka. Run the command to start a producer.)

(After the producer starts, and you get the '>' prompt, add the following ATM messages after the icon:. The messages to Kafka will be sent to the kafka topic.)

{"atmid": 1, "transid": 100}

{"atmid": 1, "transid": 101}

{"atmid": 2, "transid": 200}

{"atmid": 1, "transid": 102}

{"atmid": 2, "transid": 201}

Then, create a consumer in a new terminal window to consume these five new messages.

Open a new terminal and change to the kafka_2.12-3.7.0 directory.

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bankbranch --from-beginning

You should be able to view the five new messages that you published. However, the messages may not be consumed
in the same order as they were published. Typically, you will need to keep the consumed messages sorted in 
their original published order, especially for critical use cases, such as financial transactions.


Produce and consume with message keys


In this step, you will use message keys to ensure that messages with the same key are consumed in the same 
order as they were published. In the back end, messages with the same key are published into the same 
partition and will always be consumed by the same consumer. As such, the original publication order is 
kept on the consumer side.

At this point, you should have the following three terminals open in Cloud IDE:

Kafka Server terminal
Producer terminal
Consumer terminal
In the next steps, you will frequently switch between these terminals.

First, go to the consumer terminal and stop the consumer using Ctrl + C (Windows) or COMMAND + . (Mac).

Then, switch to the Producer terminal and stop the previous producer.

You will now start a new producer and consumer using message keys. You can start a new producer with the 
following message key options:

--property parse.key=true to make the producer parse message keys
--property key.separator=: define the key separator to be the : character, so our message with key now looks 
like the following key-value pair example:

1:{"atmid": 1, "transid": 102}

Here, the message key is 1, which also corresponds to the ATM ID, and the value is the transaction JSON 
object, {"atmid": 1, "transid": 102}.

Start a new producer with the message key enabled.

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bankbranch --property parse.key=true --property key.separator=:

Once you see the > symbol, you can start to produce the following messages, where you define each key to 
match the ATM ID for each message:

1:{"atmid": 1, "transid": 103}
1:{"atmid": 1, "transid": 104}
2:{"atmid": 2, "transid": 202}
2:{"atmid": 2, "transid": 203}
1:{"atmid": 1, "transid": 105}

Next, switch to the consumer terminal again and start a new consumer with --property print.key=true and 
--property key.separator=: arguments to print the keys.

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bankbranch --from-beginning --property print.key=true --property key.separator=:

Now, you should see that messages with the same key are being consumed in the same order

Each topic partition maintains its message queue, and new messages are enqueued (appended to the end of the 
queue) as they are published to the partition. Once consumed, the earliest messages are dequeued and no 
longer available for consumption.

Recall that with two partitions and no message keys specified, the transaction messages were published to the 
two partitions in rotation:

Partition 0: [{"atmid": 1, "transid": 100}, {"atmid": 2, "transid": 200}, {"atmid": 2, "transid": 201}]
Partition 1: [{"atmid": 1, "transid": 101}, {"atmid": 1, "transid": 102}]

As you can see, the transaction messages from atm1 and atm2 got scattered across both partitions. It would be 
difficult to unravel this and consume messages from one ATM in the same order as they were published.

However, with the message key specified as the atmid value, the messages from the two ATMs will look like the 
following:

Partition 0: [{"atmid": 1, "transid": 103}, {"atmid": 1, "transid": 104}, {"atmid": 1, "transid": 105}]
Partition 1: [{"atmid": 2, "transid": 202}, {"atmid": 2, "transid": 203}]

Messages with the same key will always be published to the same partition so that their published order will 
be preserved within the message queue of each partition.

As such, you can keep the states or orders of the transactions for each ATM.


Consumer offset


Topic partitions keep published messages in a sequence, such as a list. Message offset  indicates a message's 
position in the sequence. For example, the offset of an empty Partition 0 of bankbranch  is 0, and if you 
publish the first message to the partition, its offset will be 1.

Using offsets in the consumer, you can specify the starting position for message consumption, such as from the
beginning to retrieve all messages or from some later point to retrieve only the latest messages.

Consumer group

In addition, you normally group related consumers together as a consumer group.

For example, you may want to create a consumer for each ATM in the bank and manage all ATM-related consumers
together in a group.

So let's see how to create a consumer group, which is actually very easy with the --group argument.

In the consumer terminal, stop the previous consumer if it is still running.

Run the following command to create a new consumer within a consumer group called atm-app:

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bankbranch --group atm-app

After the consumer within the atm-app consumer group is started, you should not expect any messages to be 
consumed. This is because the offsets for both partitions have already reached the end. In other words, 
previous consumers have already consumed all messages and therefore queued them.

You can verify that by checking consumer group details.

Stop the consumer.

Show the details of the consumer group atm-app:

bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group atm-app

Now you should see the offset information for the topic bankbranch.

Recall that you have published 10 messages in total, and you can see the CURRENT-OFFSET column of partition 
1 and partition 0 add up to 10 messages.

The LOG-END-OFFSETcolumn indicates the last offset or the end of the sequence. Thus, both partitions have 
reached the end of their queues and no more messages are available for consumption.

Meanwhile, you can check the LAG column which represents the number of unconsumed messages for each partition.

Currently, it is 0 for all partitions, as expected.

Next, let's produce more messages and see how the offsets change.

Switch to the previous producer terminal and publish two more messages:

1:{"atmid": 1, "transid": 106}
2:{"atmid": 2, "transid": 204}

Switch back to the consumer terminal and check the consumer group details again.

bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group atm-app

You should see that both offsets have been increased by 1, and the LAG columns for both partitions have 
become 1. It means you have one new message for each partition to be consumed.

Start the consumer again and see whether the two new messages will be consumed.

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bankbranch --group atm-app

Both partitions have reached the end once again.

Next, let's look at how you can set the partitions to consume the messages again from the beginning through 
resetting offset.

You can reset the index with the --reset-offsets argument.

First, let's try resetting the offset to the earliest position (beginning) using --reset-offsets --to-earliest.

Stop the previous consumer if it is still running, and run the following command to reset the offset.

bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092  --topic bankbranch --group atm-app --reset-offsets --to-earliest --execute

Now, the offsets have been set to 0 (the beginning).

Start the consumer again:

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bankbranch --group atm-app

You should see that all 12 messages are consumed and that all offsets have reached the partition ends again.

You can reset the offset to any position. For example, let's reset the offset so that you only consume the 
last two messages.

Stop the previous consumer.

Shift the offset to the left by two using --reset-offsets --shift-by -2:

bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092  --topic bankbranch --group atm-app --reset-offsets --shift-by -2 --execute

If you run the consumer again, you should see that you consumed four messages, 2 for each partition:

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bankbranch --group atm-app

Stop your producer, consumer and the Kafka server.
In the terminals where you are running producer, consumer and server press CTRL+C.
