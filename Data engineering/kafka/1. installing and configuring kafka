Download and extract Kafka

wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/                      (retrieve the desired binary from folder)

tar -xzf                                                      (to extract the compressed files)

cd                                                            (into the extracted folder)   

Configure KRaft and start server

KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID="$(bin/kafka-storage.sh random-uuid)"        (generate a cluster UUID that will uniquely identify the kafka cluster. This cluster id will be used by the KRaft controller.)

bin/kafka-storage.sh format -t $KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID -c config/kraft/server.properties (KRaft requires the log directories to be configured. Run the following command to configure the log directories passing the cluster ID.)

bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties (Now that KRaft is configured, you can start the Kafka server by running the following command.)
