Create a topic

Open a new terminal and cd into the extracted kafka directory

bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic news --bootstrap-server localhost:9092       (To create a topic named news)


Create the producer

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh   --bootstrap-server localhost:9092   --topic news  (You need a producer to send messages to Kafka. Run the command to start a producer.)

(After the producer starts, and you get the '>' prompt, type any text message and press enter. The messages to Kafka will be sent to the kafka topic.)


Create the consumer

Open a new terminal and cd into the extracted kafka directory

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh   --bootstrap-server localhost:9092   --topic news   --from-beginning (Run the command to listen to the messages in the topic news)

You should see all the messages you sent from the producer appear here.

You can go back to the producer terminal and type some more messages, one message per line, and you will see them appear here.

To stop the consumer
In the terminal where you are running consumer, press CTRL+C.

To stop the producer
In the terminal where you are running producer, press CTRL+C.
