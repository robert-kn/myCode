After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Create, update, and remove a keyspace in Cassandra
Identify the keyspace for the current session with the USE command
Describe a keyspace by listing all the tables in it

Assumes you have a cassandra server running and have launched the cassandra CLI to communicate with the cluster.

Create a keyspace

The below command creates a keyspace called training, using SimpleStrategy and a replication_factor of 3.

SimpleStrategy is used when all the nodes in your cassandra cluster exist in a single data center.

On cqlsh run the below command.

CREATE KEYSPACE training WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3};

List all keyspaces.

describe keyspaces

Describe a keyspace

In the previous exercise you have created a keyspace named training.
Let us print more details of it using the describe command.

Describe a keyspace.

describe training

Alter a keyspace

In a previous exercise, you created a keyspace named training using SimpleStrategy.
Let's change that to use NetworkTopologyStrategy.

NetworkTopologyStrategy is used when all the nodes in your cassandra cluster are spread across multiple data centers.

Alter a keyspace.

ALTER KEYSPACE training WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy'};

Verify the changes using the describe command.

describe training

Use a keyspace

To use a keyspace run the below command.

use training;

List all tables in this keyspace.

describe tables

You will get an empty list because we do not have any tables yet.

Drop a keyspace

To drop a keyspace, run the below command.

drop keyspace training;

Verify the changes using the describe command.

use system;
describe keyspaces
