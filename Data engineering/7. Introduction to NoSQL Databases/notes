what is NoSQL? see nosql-1.png nosql-2 nosql-3 nosql-4 

Let's take a look at the history of the NoSQL movement going back to the period between 1970 and 2000. Although there were some 
nonrelational databases like IBMs IMS, which was a hierarchical database used for the Apollo space missions, the market was dominated 
by relational databases. So when application architects and developers needed a data store for their applications, they were pretty 
much picking from a variety of common relational databases.

When Internet applications and companies started exploding during the dot-com boom in the late nineties and early 2000s, applications went from needing to serve thousands of internal employees at companies to needing to serve millions of users on the public Internet. For these applications, availability and performance were paramount. And these new scale problems led to a drive to create new scalable technologies to support them. During that time, several large tech companies, including IBM, Google and Meta, developed a lot of innovative technology, released white papers and open sourced their technology.

In the last ten years or so, several NoSQL databases have leveraged a fully managed service model, otherwise called database as a service or DBaaS. To offload the administration and maintenance from the end user and allow developers to focus on building applications with these modern databases.

Document store databases

Document-store databases, also known as document-oriented databases, store data in a document format, typically JSON or BSON (binary JSON), where each document contains key-value pairs or key-document pairs. These databases are schema-less, allowing flexibility in data structures within a collection.

Characteristics
1. Provides schema flexibility: Documents within collections can have varying structures, allowing for easy updates and accommodation of evolving data requirements.
2. Performs efficient create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations: well-suited for read and write-intensive applications due to their ability to retrieve whole documents.
3. Provides scalability: horizontal scalability by sharding data across clusters.

Use cases
1. Content management systems (CMS): CMS platforms like WordPress use document store databases for fast storage and access to content types such as articles, images, and user data. (MongoDB)
2. E-commerce: E-commerce platforms need effective management of product catalogs with diverse attributes and hierarchies, accommodating the dynamic nature of e-commerce product listings. (Couchbase or Amazon DocumentDB, using MongoDB compatibility)

Expanded use case example: Using MongoDB for a content management system (CMS)

Content management systems (CMS) intelligently collect, govern, manage, and enrich enterprise content, including HTML pages, images, articles, and more. Content management systems help companies deploy their content efficiently and securely across any cloud and within any application.

Good content management means that team members can quickly add, update, and remove content from the database and the associated pages that feature that content. Examples include pushing out breaking news, updating current news, including weather forecasts, pushing advertising content, updating college admission policies, launching new city services, and more.

For example, using MongoDB as a backend database for a content management system (CMS) is a practical choice when you need to manage and serve a variety of content types, especially in scenarios where you expect frequent schema changes or scaling requirements.

Next, let's check out some of the aspects of managing content using a content management system, specifically using MongoDB.

Content structure using MongoDB

In MongoDB, you represent content as documents. Each document corresponds to a piece of content, such as an article, image, video, or page. You can use the subdocuments in the document to organize the content hierarchy and structure.

Example of structuring: Storing a blog post
When storing a blog post, you will store core attributes like title, content, created at, and the image URL. Then, using an array field, you can store tags. The comments on that post are stored as an array of objects.

// Collection: posts
{
"\_id":1,
"title":"Sample Blog Post",
"content":"This is the content of the blog post...",
"author":{
"name":"John Doe",
"email":"john@example.com",
"bio":"A passionate blogger.",
"created\_at":"2023-09-20T00:00:00Z"
},
"created\_at":"2023-09-20T08:00:00Z",
"tags":["mongodb","blogging","example"],
"comments":[
{
"text":"Great post!",
"author":"Emily Johnson",
"created\_at":"2023-09-20T10:00:00Z"
},
{
"text":"Thanks for sharing!",
"author":"James Martin",
"created\_at":"2023-09-20T11:00:00Z"
}
]
}

Metadata and indexing using MongoDB

You can use the indexing capabilities of MongoDB to optimize content retrieval. You can create indexes on fields commonly used for filtering or searching, such as keywords, publication date, or content type, or use MongoDB's text index support for text search queries on fields containing string content. Text indexes improve performance when searching for specific words or phrases within string content.

For example, you want to provide searching capability on the content of your blogs. You will first create a text index:

db.articles.createIndex( { subject: "text" } )

And then you can provide a query such as:

db.posts.find( { $text: { $search: "digital life" } } )

where MongoDB will look for stemmed versions of these words: digital or life

Scaling your CMS using MongoDB

As your CMS grows, MongoDB can help you scale. You can use sharding for horizontal scaling or use zone-based sharding for global distribution.

Using sharding for horizontal scaling (increased capacity)
Let's consider a company that currently has 100 million customers. This company expects to expand its customer base to 200 million customers. This increase in the number of customers means that the company will need to double its IT data storage hardware. The company can scale vertically, which can cost exponentially more as the hardware cost isn't linear with the performance. The following diagram shows that the company can scale horizontally and use sharding to manage the databases. see sharding.png

document based NoSQL databases: see document-1 document-2 document-3 document-4 document-5 

column based nosql databases: see column-db-1.png column-db-2. suitable use cases; are great for when you're dealing with large amounts of sparse data. When compared to row-oriented databases, column-based databases can better compress data and save storage space. In addition, these databases continue the trend of horizontal scalability. As with key value and document databases, column-based databases can handle being deployed across clusters of nodes. Like document databases, a column-based NoSQL database can be used for event logging and blogs, but the data would be stored in a different fashion. For enterprise logging, every application can write to its own set of columns and have each row key formatted in such a way to promote easy lookup based on application and timestamp. Counters are a unique use case for column-based databases. You may come across applications that need an easy way to count or increment as events occur. Some column-based databases, like Cassandra have special column types that allow for simple counters. In addition, columns can have a time-to-live parameter, making them useful for data with an expiration date or time like trial periods or ad timing. see column-db-3 column-db-4

Choosing the right deployment option is crucial for optimizing performance, scalability, and efficiency. Here, you'll explore some common database deployment options and their key characteristics

What you will learn

After completing this reading, you'll be able to

Identify methods for deploying NoSQL databases
List examples of NoSQL database deployments
Describe some of the advantages and challenges associated with deploying NoSQL databases

On-premises deployment
On-premises deployment involves hosting the entire database infrastructure within the organization's physical location or a dedicated data center.

Example
An organization manages customer relationship data using an on-premises Oracle Database installed on dedicated servers within its corporate data center.

Advantages

Example
A financial institution stores sensitive customer information, such as account balances, in an on-premises database while utilizing a cloud-based service, like AWS Lambda, for processing non-sensitive data analytics workloads.

Advantages
Flexibility: Companies can keep sensitive data on-premises while using the cloud for scalable and dynamic workloads.

Disaster recovery: Companies can use cloud storage for backups, enhancing disaster recovery capabilities.

Challenges
Integration complexity: Integration complexities require effective integration between on-premises and cloud environments for seamless operation.

Management overhead: Monitoring and managing two different environments might increase administrative complexity.

Database as a service (DBaaS)
DBaaS provides a fully managed database solution where the service provider handles administrative tasks, allowing organizations to focus on application development.

Example
A software development company uses Microsoft Azure SQL Database as a DBaaS solution to host and manage its relational databases, allowing developers to focus on application development rather than database administration tasks.

Advantages
Reduced overhead: Organizations benefit from reduced administrative tasks, including maintenance, backups, and updates.

Rapid deployment: Quick deployment without the need for in-depth database expertise.

Challenges
Limited control: Organizations have less control over underlying infrastructure, which might be a concern for some organizations.

Data security: Trusting a third-party provider with sensitive data raises security and privacy considerations.

Containerized deployment
Containerization involves packaging the database and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across various environments.

Example
A tech company adopts Docker containers to deploy its microservices-based application, with each microservice encapsulating a specific function and a separate container running a MongoDB database.

Advantages
Portability: Containers ensure consistent operation across development, testing, and production environments.

Resource efficiency: Lightweight containers consume fewer resources compared to traditional virtual machines.

Challenges
Orchestration complexity: Production-scale deployment requires knowledge of container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

Learning curve: Teams might need to familiarize themselves with containerization concepts and tools.

Serverless deployment
Serverless architecture provisions and scales database resources automatically based on demand, with organizations paying for actual usage.

Example
A mobile app developer utilizes Google Cloud Firestore as a serverless NoSQL database for storing user data, where the database scales automatically based on demand, and the developer only pays for the data storage and operations used by the app.

Advantages
No manual provisioning: No need for manual provisioning or maintenance of server resources.

Cost savings: Efficient resource utilization leads to cost savings as organizations only pay for the resources consumed.

Challenges
Limited control: Organizations have less control over underlying infrastructure, which might concern some organizations.

Applicability: Serverless might not be suitable for all types of databases or workloads due to architectural constraints.

Recap
In this reading, you learned that:

The choice of a database deployment option depends on organizational priorities, budget constraints, scalability needs, and how the company manages the nature of the data. It's essential to carefully evaluate these options in alignment with specific use cases to ensure optimal performance and efficiency.

On-premises deployment involves hosting the entire database infrastructure within the organization's physical location or a dedicated data center, providing full control and compliance with regulatory requirements but with high upfront costs and limited scalability.

Cloud deployment uses cloud service providers to host and manage databases. Cloud deployment offers scalability, cost-effectiveness, and automation. However, cloud deployments have connectivity dependencies and can be prone to security concerns.

Hybrid deployment combines on-premises and cloud solutions, allowing organizations to distribute data and workloads based on specific needs, providing flexibility and enhanced disaster recovery capabilities; however, effective integration between on-premises and cloud environments requires increased administrative complexity and costs.

Database as a Service (DBaaS) provides a fully managed database solution where the company's choice service provider handles administrative tasks. When using DBaaS, organizations focus on application development but usually have limited control over underlying infrastructure and data security.

Containerized deployment involves packaging the database and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across various environments, which can ensure consistent operations and resource efficiency—however, if containerization practices are not already in place, the company will need time for employees to gain knowledge of container orchestration tools and implement them.

Serverless deployment provisions and scales database resources automatically based on demand, with organizations paying for actual usage, eliminating manual provisioning and maintenance of server resources, and leading to cost savings. However, companies usually have limited control over the underlying infrastructure, and serverless deployments might not be technically suitable for all databases or workloads.
