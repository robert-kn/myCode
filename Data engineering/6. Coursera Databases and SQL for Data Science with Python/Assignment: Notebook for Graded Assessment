Introduction

Using this Python notebook you will:

Understand three Chicago datasets
Load the three datasets into three tables in a SQLIte database
Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions

Understand the datasets

To complete the assignment problems in this notebook you will be using three datasets that are available on the city of Chicago's Data Portal:

Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
Chicago Public Schools
Chicago Crime Data

1. Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.

A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:

https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2

2. Chicago Public Schools
This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. This dataset is provided by the city of Chicago's Data Portal.

A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:

https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t

3. Chicago Crime Data
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.

A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:

https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2


Download the datasets
This assignment requires you to have these three tables populated with a subset of the whole datasets.

In many cases the dataset to be analyzed is available as a .CSV (comma separated values) file, perhaps on the internet.

Use the links below to read the data files using the Pandas library.

NOTE: Ensure you use the datasets available on the links above instead of directly from the Chicago Data Portal. The versions linked here are subsets of the original datasets and have some of the column names modified to be more database friendly which will make it easier to complete this assignment.

Execute the below code cell to avoid prettytable default error.


!pip install ipython-sql prettytable

import prettytable

prettytable.DEFAULT = 'DEFAULT'


Store the datasets in database tables
To analyze the data using SQL, it first needs to be loaded into SQLite DB. We will create three tables in as under:

CENSUS_DATA
CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA

Load the pandas and sqlite3 libraries and establish a connection to FinalDB.db

!pip install pandas
import sqlite3 pandas
conn = sqlite3.connect("FinalDB.db")
cur = conn.cursor()


Load the SQL magic module

%load_ext sql


Use Pandas to load the data available in the links above to dataframes. Use these dataframes to load data on to the database FinalDB.db as required tables.

df1 = pandas.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera_V5/data/ChicagoCensusData.csv?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork20127838-2021-01-01")
df1.to_sql("CENSUS_DATA", conn, if_exists='replace', index=False,method="multi")

df2 = pandas.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera_V5/data/ChicagoPublicSchools.csv?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork20127838-2021-01-01")
df2.to_sql("CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS", conn, if_exists='replace', index=False,method="multi")

df3 = pandas.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera_V5/data/ChicagoCrimeData.csv?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork20127838-2021-01-01")
df3.to_sql("CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA", conn, if_exists='replace', index=False,method="multi")


Establish a connection between SQL magic module and the database FinalDB.db

%sql sqlite:///FinalDB.db
You can now proceed to the the following questions. Please note that a graded assignment will follow this lab and there will be a question on each of the problems stated below. It can be from the answer you received or the code you write for this problem. Therefore, please keep a note of both your codes as well as the response you generate.
