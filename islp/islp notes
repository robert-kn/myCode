Y = f(X) + e  (2.1)

What does the above equation represent? the relationship between the response y and the predictor(s). Where
X = (X₁, X₂, X₃...Xₚ) represents different predictors that we assume have a relationship with Y. Y could be 
sales and X could represent advertising budgets of different mediums.

Predictors are also known as independent variables or featuress.
Response is also known as the dependent variable.

f is some fixed but unknown function of X₁...Xₚ and e is a random error term which is independent of X and 
has mean zero (what does this mean? read description in figure22.png to understand)

It is all about finding the function that connects the predictors such that a response can be
determined. This function is usually estimated. Once it is estimated the vertical lines from the 
observed values to the estimated function represent the error associated with each observation.
If an observation lies above the curve, the error is positive; if it lies below, the error is 
negative. Overall the errors have a mean of zero.

In general a function f may involve more than one input variable see figure23.png Here, income
is plotted as a function of years of education and seniority. f is 2d surface that must be estimated
based on the observed data.

In essence statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating f.

Why estimate f?
