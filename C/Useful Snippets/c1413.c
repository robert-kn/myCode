/* Defne the structure type node with members: code, name, grade, and a pointer to a structure of type node. Create a list whose nodes are structures of that type. 
Write a program that displays a menu to perform the following operations:

1. Insert a student at the end of the list. The program should read the student’s data and store them in a node, which becomes the new tail of the list.
2. Insert a student in a specifc place. The program should read the code of a student, locate the corresponding node with that code, and create a new node after that to insert the data of the new student.
3. Display the data of the stored students.
4. Find a student. The program should read the code of a student and display its data, if registered.
5. Modify the grade of a student. The program should read the code of a student and the new grade and modify the existing grade.
6. Delete a student. The program should read the code of a student and remove the node that corresponds to that student, if registered.
7. Program termination.
