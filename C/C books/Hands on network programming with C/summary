chapter 1

1. why is C great to work with when it comes to learning networking? think of details, kernels. compare it to python in terms of downloading a web page
2. what do you think of interms of the internet and connected devices (and increasingly IOT)?
3. can you think of any networking stack that is not written in C?
4. can you think of the different abstraction levels involved in networking?
5. can you think of the two theoretical models that help you understand networking communications at the different levels of abstraction?
6. can you name the different layers of osi theoretical model and what each level entails?
7. where do applications such as web browsers lie in the OSI layer? can you give an example of a protocol in this layer? 
8. are chunks of data referred to by different names depending on what layer of the osi they are on? 
9. what do the lower level protocols do for the higher level protocols?
10. which of the two communication models is most widely used today?
11. how does the TCP/IP suite differ from the OSI model?
12. can you name the different levels of the TCP/IP suite?
13. since lower level data structures must encapsulate higher level data structures, what does this mean when you are working at say level 7 of the OSI model?
14. does data need to be processed down through the layers and up through the layers again when communication between two devices is occuring?
15. can you visually picture (in terms of how data is wrapped in different headers as it moves through the different layers) what happens when when a web request is made by an end-system?
16. can you name at least one protocol that was competing with TCP/IP 20 years ago?
17. what are some of the reasons you can think of why TCP/IP won the protocol war?
18. how many versions does the IP come in? how many bits are used in each version?
19. why was IPV6 invented?
20. what is a dual stack configuration?
21. what is an IP address?
22. for an IPV4 address, how many sections is it divided into?
23. what is the loopback address and what is it used for?
24. how many sets of RFC 1918 addresses are there? can you name them?
25. what does CIDR stand for and what is used for?
26. how does CIDR notation work?
27. how many group are IPV6 addressed divided into?
28. what are the 2 rules that are used to shorted IPV6 addresses?
29. what is the loop back address for IPV6?
30. there is a special class of ipv6 addresses that map directly to ipv4 addresses. what do these addresses start with?
31. whaat are these addresses called fec0::/10? what are they used for? have they been deprecated?
32. what are link local addresses? do routers forward packets to them? 169.254.0.0/16 ipv4 example and fe80::/10 ipv6 address
33. what is the essence of DNS?
34. what does AAAA record return?
35. what about an AA record?
36. what is the name of the windows utility that lists routers between two hosts?
37. what is the equivalent of the windows utility for unix/linux/macos?
38. what are the three ipv4 ranges reserved for private networks?
39. if a device in a privte network want to communicate with another device on the wider internet, wht must happen?
40. does ipv6 avoid the NAT? why? 
41. how does a router know whether a packet can be delivered locally or it must be forwarded? use of subnet mask, net mask, or CIDR
42. IP addresses are split into two parts, what are the two paarts called?
43. what does IPV4 use to identify IP address parts? mask notation. For example, consider a router on the 10.0.0.0 network with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This router can take any incoming packet and perform a bitwise AND operation with the subnet mask to determine whether the packet belongs on the local subnet or needs to be forwarded on. For example, this router receives a packet to be delivered to 10.0.0.105. It does a bitwise AND operation on this address with the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which produces 10.0.0.0. That matches the subnet of the router, so the traffic is local. If, instead, we consider a packet destined for 10.0.15.22, the result of the bitwise AND with the subnet mask is 10.0.15.0. This address doesn't match the subnet the router is on, and so it must be forwarded.
44. does ipv6 use CIDR?
45. how do we describe a situation when a packet is routed from one sender to one receiver? unicast addressing
46. define broadcast addressing? a single sender to address a packet to all recipients simultaneously.
47. define multi-cast addressing? one to many communication; it involves group management as the message is addressed and delivered to members of a group
48. define anycast addressing? packet is delivered to one recipient when you dont care who the recipient is
49. application level multi-casting and ip multicasting are two different things
50. what is an ip address used for? to route a packet to a particular system
51. once the packet arrives at the destination system, how does the system know which application should handle it?
52. how many bits are used to store port numbers?
53. what organisation assigns port numbers for specific protocols? IANA
54. describe the client-server model? a server listens for connections, a client knowing the address and the port number that the server is listening on, sends the first packet
55. what is a socket? one endpoint of a communication link between systems; think of it as an abstraction that your application can use to send and receive data over a network
56. an open socket is uniquely defined by tuple of 5 items made up of? 
57. what is the 5 tuple item used by? 
58. wht other system uses the 5 tuple item to keep track of connections? NAT gateway stores a 5 tuple item for each connection in order to know how to route ingress packets into the private network
59. what comman can you use to find your ip address on a windows machine? ipconfig
60. what command can you use to find your address on a mac/linux/unix? ifconfig or ip addr
61. do ethernet adapters serve the same purpose as network interface cards? 
62. what do the commands ipconfig, ifconfig, ip addr show? the ip addresses associated with each adapter on a pc
63. if a device is operating behind a NAT, how can one find out its public ip address? contact an internet server that provides an API that informs you of the IP address
64. can you name a few of these public APIs? http://api.ipify.org/, http://icanhazip.com/, http://ifconfig.me
65. what is the windows networking api called? winsock
