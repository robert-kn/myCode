/**
 * Exercise 1.3.1 
 * 
 * Explain the difference between the static and dynamic aspects of a data model:
 * 
 * Static part of a data model refers to the values that objects can assume e.g. a certain objects can have integer 
 * values. The static part of a programming languageâ€™s data model is often called the type system.
 * 
 * The dynamic part of a data model refers operations on the data i.e. ways in which we can change values and create 
 * new values.
