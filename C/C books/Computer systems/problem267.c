// You are given the task of writing a procedure int_size_is_32() that yields 1 when run on a machine for which an 
// int is 32 bits, and yields 0 otherwise. You are not allowed to use the sizeof operator. Here is a first attempt:

// 1 /* The following code does not run properly on some machines */
// 2 int bad_int_size_is_32() {
// 3 /* Set most significant bit (msb) of 32-bit machine */
// 4    int set_msb = 1 << 31;
// 5 /* Shift past msb of 32-bit word */
// 6    int beyond_msb = 1 << 32;
// 7
// 8 /* set_msb is nonzero when word size >= 32
// 9 beyond_msb is zero when word size <= 32 */
// 10   return set_msb && !beyond_msb;
// 11 }

// When compiled and run on a 32-bit SUN SPARC, however, this procedure returns 0. The following compiler message gives 
// us an indication of the problem:

// warning: left shift count >= width of type

// A. In what way does our code fail to comply with the C standard?
// B. Modify the code to run properly on any machine for which data type int is at least 32 bits.
// C. Modify the code to run properly on any machine for which data type int is at least 16 bits.
