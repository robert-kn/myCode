Following the bit-level floating-point coding rules, implement the function with the following prototype:

/*
 * Compute (int) f.
 * If conversion causes overflow or f is NaN, return 0x80000000
 */
int float_f2i(float_bits f);

For floating-point number f, this function computes (int) f. Your function should round toward zero. If f cannot be represented as an integer (e.g., it is out of range, or it is NaN), then the function should return 0x80000000.
Test your function by evaluating it for all 2^(32) values of argument f and comparing the result to what would be obtained using your machine's floating-point operations.
