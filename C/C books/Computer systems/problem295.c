Following the bit-level floating-point coding rules, implement the function with the following prototype:

/* Compute 0.5*f. If f is NaN, then return f. */
float_bits float_half(float_bits f);

For floating-point number f, this function computes 0.5 · f. If f is NaN, your function should simply return f.
Test your function by evaluating it for all 2^(32) values of argument f and comparing the result to what would be obtained using your machine's floating-point operations.
