/* Write a program that reads the names of 20 bookstores and 500 book titles. Use
two two-dimensional arrays to store them. Assume that all names are less than 100 char-
acters. The program should also read for each bookstore the number of copies left in stock
for each title. Then, the program should read a book title and display the names of the
bookstores that offer this title and the number of copies of that title in those bookstores.
Finally, the program should read the name of a bookstore and display its total number of
copies left in stock. */
