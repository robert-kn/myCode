/* Write a program that reads a string of less than 100 characters, how many charac-
ters are going to be deleted, and the position of the first character to be deleted. After the
deletion, the rest part of the string should be shifted to the left, a number of places equal
to the number of the deleted characters. The program should display the string before it
ends. For example, if the input string is test case and the numbers are 4 and 2, the pro-
gram should display tcase. The program should check the validity of the input numbers
in order to ensure that the characters are contained in the string. */
