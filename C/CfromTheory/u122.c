/* Write a program that reads the names of 50 students (less than 100 characters
each) and stores them in an array. Suppose that the user enters the names in alphabetical
order. Use a second array and do the same for another group of 70 students. The program
should merge the two arrays into a third one, where all names should be stored in alpha-
betical order. */
