/**
 * Write a program that simulates hotel booking software. Assume that the hotel has 10 wings of 50 rooms each. The program should display a menu to 
 * perform the following operations:
 * 
 * 1. Display the number of available rooms in each wing.
 * 2. Make a reservation. The program should prompt the user to enter a wing number. Then, it reserves the first available room in that wing. 
 * If there is no available room, the program should prompt the user to enter a new wing until the reservation is made.
 * 3. Cancel a reservation. The program should prompt the user to enter the wing num- ber and the room number and cancel the reservation.
 * 4. Program termination.
