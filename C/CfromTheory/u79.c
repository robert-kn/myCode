/**
 * Write a program that reads integers and stores them in a square matrix (e.g., 3Ã—3). Then, the program should check whether the array is upper triangular, 
 * lower triangular or both. A square matrix is called upper (lower) triangular if all its elements below (above) the main diagonal are zero.
