 * Write a program that reads a month number (1 for January, 12 for December) and the day number (for example, if the input month is January, the valid values are from 1 to 31) 
 * and displays the date after 50 days. In case of February, the program should prompt the user to enter its days, that is, 28 or 29. For example, if the user enters 3 for month, 
 * and 5 for day, the program should display: 4/24.
