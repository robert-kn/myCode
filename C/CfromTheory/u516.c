/**
 * Write a program that reads three integers and the user’s choice and uses the switch statement to support three cases. If the user’s choice is 1, 
 * the program should check if the integers are different and display a message. If it is 2, it should check if any two of them are equal, and if it 
 * is 3, it should display how many of them are within [−5, 5].
