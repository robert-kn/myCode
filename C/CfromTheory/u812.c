/**
 * Write a program that reads 100 integers and stores them in an array. Then, the pro- gram should replace the duplicated values with -99. Use pointer arithmetic to process the array. For example, if the array were {5, 5, 5, 5, 5} 
 * the program should make it {5, -99, -99, -99, -99} and if it were {-2, 3, -2, 50, 3} it should make it {-2, 3, -99, 50, -99}.
