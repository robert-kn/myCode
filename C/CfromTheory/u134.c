/* Defne the structure type circle with member the radius and the type square with member the length. Write a function that takes 
as parameters a pointer of type void* Â and an integer parameter. If its value is 0, the pointer points to a structure of type 
circle, otherwise to a structure of type square. The function should increase the mem- ber of the pointed structure by 5 and 
return that pointer. Write a program to test the function. */
