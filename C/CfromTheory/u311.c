/**
 * Write a program that reads a four-digit positive integer and a one-digit positive integer. The 
 * program should display the value of a five-digit integer, which is produced by inserting the one-digit integer 
 * into the middle of the four-digit integer. For example, if the user enters 1234 and 5, the program should 
 * display 12534.
