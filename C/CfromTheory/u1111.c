/* Write a void function that takes as parameters a 3×4 two-dimensional array, a
row number, and a column number and uses proper parameters to return the largest value
in that row and the smallest value in that column. Write a program that reads 12 integers
and stores them in a 3×4 two-dimensional array. Then, the program should read a row
number and a column number and use the function to display the largest value in that row
and the smallest value in that column. */
