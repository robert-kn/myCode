/**
 * Write a program that reads 100 double numbers and stores them in an array. The program should calculate the distance between successive elements and 
 * display the mini- mum one. To calculate the distance of two elements, subtract their values and use the abso- lute value. For example, if the first four 
 * elements are 5.2, -3.2, 7.5, 12.22, the distances are |-3.2-5.2| = 8.4, |7.5-(-3.2)| = 10.7 and |12.22-7.5| = 4.72.
