/* Write a program that reads the populations of 100 cities and stores them in
ascending order in an array when entered. The program should display the array before
it ends. For example, if the users enters 2000 and then 1000, the first two elements should
be 1000, 2000. If the next input value is 1500, the first three elements should be 1000,
1500, and 2000. */
