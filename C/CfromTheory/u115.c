/* Write a void function that takes as parameters two arrays and the number of the
elements (e.g., N) to compare. If the N first elements are the same, the function should
return 1, 0 otherwise. Write a program that reads 200 double numbers and stores them
in two arrays of 100 elements each. Then, the program should read the number of the ele-
ments to be compared, use the function to compare them, and display the result. Hint: since
the return type is void add a pointer argument to return the result of the comparison. */
