/* Write a program that reads 20 strings (less than 100 characters each) and stores
them in a two-dimensional array. Then, the program should:

a. Read a column number and display the words that are contained in that column,
including those that consist of a single character. In an example with five strings,
if the user enters: 

abcdegm
abcdfpoloo
abcd
abc
abcdkmop

and the number 6 as column, the program should display:
word_1: gp
word_2: m

b. Read a row number, except the first one, and if the string in that row contains less
than five different lowercase letters, the program should swap that string with the
string in the first row.
