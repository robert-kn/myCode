/**
 * Write a program that reads an integer that corresponds to a number of lines. 
 * Suppose that the user enters 4. The program should add spaces and '*' according 
 * to the line number, as shown in the following (three spaces at the left of 
 * one '*' in the first line, two spaces at the left of two '*' in the second 
 * line, and so on). When the last line is reached, the program should display in 
 * each line one '*' less, and the spaces at the right of '*', until one '*' is 
 * displayed.
