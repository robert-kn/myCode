/**
 * Write a program that reads a positive integer and another integer that represents a number of bytes (e.g., n). 
 * The program should rotate the input number, n bytes to the right, and display the new value. Assume that the size 
 * of the int type is 32 bits and the user enters a valid value for n within [1, 3]. For example, if the user enters 
 * 553799974 (binary: 00100001|00000010|01010001|00100110) and 1, the program should display: 639697489 
 * (binary: 00100110|00100001|00000010|01010001).
