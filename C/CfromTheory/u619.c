/**
 * Write a program that reads two integers (e.g., M, N) and produces a M×N grid. 
 * Each grid cell should be 3×2 characters wide. As an example, a 3×5 grid follows:
 * +--+--+--+--+--+ 
 * |  |  |  |  |  | 
 * +--+--+--+--+--+ 
 * |  |  |  |  |  | 
 * +--+--+--+--+--+ 
 * |  |  |  |  |  |
 * +--+--+--+--+--+
 * 
 * The three horizontal characters of each cell are: +-- and the two verticals are: +|
