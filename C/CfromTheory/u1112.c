/* Write a function that takes as parameters a two-dimensional array and an integer
and returns a pointer to the row in which that number appears the most times. If the num-
ber is not found, the function should return NULL. Write a program that assigns random
values to a 5x5 array of integers, it reads an integer and uses the function to display the
elements of the row in which it appears the most times. Note: if the number appears in
more than one row the same most times, the function should return the pointer to the first
found. */
