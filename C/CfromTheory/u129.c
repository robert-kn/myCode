/* Write a program that reads the names of 10 courses (less than 100 characters each)
and the grades of 50 students on those courses. The program should display the names of
the courses and the average grade next to them, starting with the course with the best aver-
age. In case of same average, the program should display the “tied” courses in alphabetical
order. To sort the array, use the bubble sort algorithm. */
