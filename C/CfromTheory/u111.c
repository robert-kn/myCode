/* Write a function that takes as parameters three integers and checks if the sum of
the first two numbers is equal to the third one. If it is, the function should return the larger
of the first two numbers; otherwise, the smaller of the second and the third one. Write a
program that reads three integers, calls the function, and displays the return value. */
