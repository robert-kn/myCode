/* Write a program that reads 20 strings (less than 100 characters each) and stores
them in a two-dimensional array. Then, the program should read a string, and if it is found
in the array, it should be removed. To remove the string, move the strings below that point
one row up. In the place of the last row moving up, insert the null character. For example,
if the array is: 

one
two
three
four
...

and the user enters two, the new content should be:

one
three
four
...
