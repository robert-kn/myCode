/**
 * Write a program that assigns random values within [1000, 2000] to the elements of the main diagonal of a 5Ã—5 integer array. The program should assign 
 * random values to the remaining elements with the restriction that the values of the elements below the main diagonal should be less than those of the 
 * main diagonal, and the values of the elements above the main diagonal should be greater than those of the main diagonal.
