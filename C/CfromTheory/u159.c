/* Write a program that reads the name of a text fle from the command line and displays its longest line. Assume that there is no more than one line with the same longer length. 
The program should also display the occurrences of each digit [0, 9] in the fle. 
Furthermore, the program should read an integer (e.g., x) and display the last x lines of the fle. The program should check that the input number is not greater than the number of the 
total lines. For example, if the user enters 3 the program should display the last three lines of the fle. There is one restriction; the program should read each line only once. Assume 
that there are fewer than 1000 lines and each line contains fewer than 100 characters. */
