/* Suppose that each lowercase letter has a value as follows. The letters 'a' up to 'i'
correspond to units; 'a' has the value 1 and 'i' is 9. The letters 'j' up to 'r' correspond
to tens; 'j' has the value 10 and 'r' is 90. The rest correspond to hundreds; 's' has the
value 100 and 'z' is 800.
Write a program that continuously reads strings (less than 100 characters each) and dis-
plays the strings with the largest and smallest value and those values as well, before it
ends. For example, the value of cky is 723, while the value of A9m is 40, since the charac-
ters 'A' and '9' donâ€™t have a value. If more than one string has the same largest or smallest
value, the program should display the one entered last. If the user enters ***, the insertion
of strings should terminate. */
