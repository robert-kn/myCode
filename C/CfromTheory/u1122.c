/* Write a program that generates 10 random integers and stores them in an array.
Then, the program should call a recursive function to check if the array is symmetric, that
is, if the value of the first element is equal to the last one, the value of the second one equal
to the value of the last but one, and so on. If the array is not symmetric, the function should
return the position of the first element that breaks the symmetry. */
