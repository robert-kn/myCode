 * A factory produces small and big bottles. A small one costs $0.008 and a big one $0.02. For orders of more than $200 or 
 * more than 3000 bottles in total, a discount of 8% is offered. For orders of more than $600, the discount is 20%. Write a 
 * program that reads the number of small and big bottles ordered and displays the total cost.
