/* Write a program that reads three strings of less than 100 characters and stores them
in three arrays (e.g., str1, str2, and str3). Then, the program should copy their contents
one place right, meaning that the content of str3 should be copied to str1, the content of
str1 to str2, and that of str2 to str3. */
