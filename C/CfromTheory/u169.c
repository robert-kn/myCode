/* Modify the macro of the previous exercise in order to display the result of math
operations applied on both integers and floats.
#define f(a, sign, b, fmt) ...
The fmt argument should be either %d or %f. Write a program that reads an integer and
a double number (not 0 in case of division) and a math sign and uses the macro to display
the result of the math operation. */
