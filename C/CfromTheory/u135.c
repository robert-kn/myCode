/* Defne the structure type student with members: name and code. Assume that a classroom can be simulated by a two-dimensional 
array whose elements are structures of type student. Write a program that reads the data of students and stores them in a 3Ã—5 
array of structures. Then, the program should read the name of a student and his or her code and display his position in the 
array (i.e., row and column), if registered. */
