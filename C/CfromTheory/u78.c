 * Write a program that reads the grades of 100 students and displays the frequency of each grade. The program should also display the grade which is 
 * given the most times and the number of its occurrences. Examine the case that more than one grade might be given the same most times. The program should 
 * force the user to enter grades within [0, 10]. Assume that the grades are integers.
