/* Defne the union type selected_type with the members named u_char (of type char), u_int (of type int), u_float (of type float), and 
u_double (of type double). Defne the structure type var_type with the members named type (of type int) and st 
(union of type selected_type). Write a function that takes as parameter a structure of type var_type. The function should read a 
number according to the value of the type member, store that number in the appropriate st member, and display the value of that member. 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number that represents the data type (i.e., 1: char, 2: int, 3: float, 4: double) and 
then uses the function to read a corresponding value and display it.
