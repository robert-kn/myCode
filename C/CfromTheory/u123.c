/* Write a program that reads the names of 20 cities (less than 100 characters each)
and the average monthly temperatures for each city. Then, the program should read a city
name and display the warmest month (e.g., 1:Jan â€“ 12:Dec) for that city. Also, the program
should display for the same city the months with higher temperature than the previous
and next month. */
