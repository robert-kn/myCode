/* Defne the structure type publisher with members: name, address, and e-mail. Defne the type book with members: title, authors, 
code, price, and a member of type publisher. Assume that the texts are less than 100 characters. Write a program that uses the 
type book to read the data of 100 books and store them in an array. Then, the program should read a book’s code and display the
