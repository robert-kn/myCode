/**
 * Write a program that reads 100 integers and stores them in an array. The program should display the number of the duplicated values. For example, if the 
 * array were of five elements {5, 5, 5, 5, 5} the program should display 4 (since number 5 is repeated four times), and if it were {1, -3, 1, 50, -3} the 
 * program should display 2 (since numbers 1 and -3 are repeated once), and if it were {3, -1, 22, 13, -7} the program should display 0 (since no number is 
 * repeated).
