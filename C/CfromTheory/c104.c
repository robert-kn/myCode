/**
 * Answer: Recall from Chapter 8 that the name of an array when used as a pointer is a 
 * constant pointer, meaning that it is not allowed to change its value and point to some 
 * other address. Therefore, the statement 
 * temp = str1; is illegal. The same applies for the next two statements, so the program wonâ€™t 
 * compile.
