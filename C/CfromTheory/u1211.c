/* Write a program that reads the prices and the book titles (less than 100 characters
each) of two bookstores. Assume that the maximum number of books in each bookstore is
200. If the user enters end for book title, the insertion of books should terminate. The pro-
gram should display the book titles and prices of both bookstores sorted by price descend-
ing order. There is one restriction. If a title is found in both bookstores, the program should
display that title once with the price in the first bookstore. */
