/* Suppose that each line of the students.txt text fle contains the name of a student (less than 100 characters) and his grades in three courses. Write a program that reads the fle and displays the 
name(s) of the student(s) with the best average grade. Assume that there are fewer than 300 students and more than one student may have the same best average grade.
