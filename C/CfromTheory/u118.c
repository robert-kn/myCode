/* Write a function that takes as parameter an array and checks if it contains dupli-
cated values. If so, the function should return a pointer to the element that appears the
most times, otherwise NULL. Write a program that reads 100 integers, stores them in an
array, and uses the function to display the element with the most occurrences. Note: if
more than one element appears the same most times, the function should return the first
found. */
