/**
 * Write a program that reads the initial height from which a ball is thrown and 
 * displays after how many bounces the ball reaches a height less than 1‚ÅÑ4 of the 
 * initial height. The program should prompt the user to enter the decrease height 
 * ratio (%). For example, the input value 0.1 means that each time the ball hits 
 * the ground, it bounces up to a height 10% less than the previous one.
