/* Defne the structure type student with members: name, code, and grade. Write a  program that declares an array of six such structures 
and initializes the frst fve with ran- dom data sorted by grade in ascending order (e.g., "A.Smith, 100, 3.2", "B.Jones, 200, 4.7", 
"K.Lee, 175, 6.4", ...). Then, the program should read the data of the sixth student and store them in the proper position, so that 
the array remains sorted.
