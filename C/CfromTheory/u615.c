/**
 * Write a program that uses rand() to generate the integers 0 and 1 in a random 
 * manner. The program should read an integer that corresponds to rand() calls and 
 * dis- plays the maximum number of successive 0 and 1 pairs in the generated 
 * sequence. For example, if the user enters 15, rand() should be called 15 times, 
 * and if, letâ€™s say, the gen- erated sequence is 010011010100100, the program 
 * should display 2 because that is the maximum number of pairs with successive 
 * 01.
