/* Write a function (e.g., f()) that takes as parameters an integer (e.g., a) and a pointer
to another function (e.g., g()). g() accepts an integer argument, and if that argument is
positive, it returns the corresponding negative; otherwise, it returns the argument as is. If
a is even, f() should use the pointer to call g() and display the return value. If it is odd
(e.g., 5), it should change it to the next even (e.g., 6) and then call g(). Write a program that
reads an integer and uses a pointer variable to call f(). Note: revisit the section “Pointer to
Function” in Chapter 8.*/
