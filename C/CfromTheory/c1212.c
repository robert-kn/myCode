/* Comments: Suppose that the user enters the values 2, 15, 4, 1, 7, 20, 5. Letâ€™s trace
the first call of partition(). We have i=l=0, j=r-1=5, v=a[6]=5. The first loop performs
the left scan and terminates once i becomes 1 (since a[1] > 5). The second loop per-
forms the right scan and terminates once j becomes 3 (since a[3] < 5). The two elements
are swapped and the array is transformed to 2, 1, 4, 15, 7, 20, 5.

Left scan continues and terminates once i becomes 3 (since a[3] > 5). Right scan con-
tinues and terminates once j becomes 2 (since a[2] < 5). Because i > j the infinite loop
terminates. a[3] and a[6] are swapped and the array is transformed to 2, 1, 4, 5, 7, 20,
15. Notice that 5 is set in its final position and all elements in its left are less, while all ele-
ments in its right are greater. The function returns the value of i, that is, 3. Then, recursion
is used to repeat the same procedure for the left subarray (positions 0 to 2) and for the right
subarray (positions 4 to 6).*/
