/* To continue the previous exercise, the program should check if the input string cor-
responds to a float number and assign that number to a numerical variable. For example, 
if the user enters the string 12, the program should assign the number 12 to a variable. If
the user enters the string -1.234 the assigned value should be -1.234. */
