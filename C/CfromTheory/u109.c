/* Write a program that reads a string of less than 100 characters and stores it in an
array. Then, the program should delete from the array all the characters that are not letters,
the multiple repetitions of the same letter, and display the new string. For example, if the
string jA*8%cr1^c is stored in the array, the program should change its content to jAcr.
There is one restriction; donâ€™t use a second array to store the characters that are not deleted. */
