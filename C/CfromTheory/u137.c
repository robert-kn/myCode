/* Defne the structure type time with members: hours, minutes, and seconds. Write a function that takes as parameters two 
pointers to two structures that represent the start time and the end time of a game and returns the game’s duration as a 
structure. Write a program that uses the type time to read the start time of a game and the end time and uses the function 
to display the game’s duration. The user should enter the time in h:m:s format.  */
