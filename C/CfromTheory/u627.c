/**
 * Write a program that reads a positive integer and checks if it is an Armstrong 
 * number. An Armstrong number is a number that it is equal to the sum of its 
 * digits raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, the three-digit 
 * number 153 is an Armstrong number, because 1^(3) + 5^(3) + 3^(3) = 1 + 125 + 
 * 27 = 153.
