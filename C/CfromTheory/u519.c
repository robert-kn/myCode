 * Write a program that calculates the cost of renting a vehicle, according to Table 5.5.
 * 
 * The program should read the type of the vehicle and the days to rent it and use the switch statement to display the cost. Also, the 
 * program should ask the user if an insurance cover- age is desired, and if the answer is positive, an extra 5% in the total cost should be charged.
