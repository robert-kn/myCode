/* Write a program that provides a menu to perform the following operations: 

1. Intersection. The program reads the common size of two arrays (e.g., A and B) and allocates memory 
dynamically to store their elements. Then, it reads integers and stores into A those that are not already 
stored. Then, it does the same for the array B. The program should store the common elements of the two 
arrays into a third array and display them.
2. Union. The program should store the elements of both arrays A and B into a third array. Notice that a 
common element should be stored once.
3. Program termination.
