/* Defne the structure type any_type with an integer member (e.g., s_type) and a member of type union. The unionâ€™s members are a 
structure of type time (e.g., t) as defned in U.13.7 and a structure of type student (e.g., s) as defned in U.13.6. Write a program 
that reads an integer and stores it into the s_type member of a structure vari- able of type any_type. Then, the program should 
check the value of s_type and read data according to that value. If it is 1 the input, data should be stored into the t member; 
otherwise, it should be stored into the s member.
