/**
 * Write a program that assigns random values within [0, 20] to the elements of a 3Ã—5 integer array, except the last row. The elements of the last row 
 * should be assigned with proper values so that the sum of the elements in each column is 50. The program should also store into a one-dimensional array 
 * the minimum value of each column of the two- dimensional array and display that array, before it terminates.
