/* Defne a structure of type band with members: name, category, singer (all less than 100 characters), and records. Suppose that the test.bin binary fle contains such structures. The number of 
bands is declared in the beginning of the fle. Write a program that reads the fle and uses the structure type to store the data in a dynamically allocated memory. Then, the program should read 
the name of a band, a new singer, and replace the existing singer with the new one.*/
