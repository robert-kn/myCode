/**
 * Write a program that reads an integer and the positions of two bits and displays the value of the bits between them. 
 * The program should find the size of the int type; donâ€™t assume that it is 32 bits. For example, if the user enters 
 * 176 (binary: 10110000) and the values 6 and 4, the program should display the value of the bits between the 
 * positions 6 and 4, that is, the decimal value of the bits 110, which is 6.
