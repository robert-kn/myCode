/* In a music contest, 200 judges vote for the top songs out of 50 songs. Write
a program that reads the names of the songs (less than 100 characters each) and dis-
plays the top five songs. If there is a tie in the fifth place, the program should display
the “tied” songs. To vote for a song, the judge enters its title. Each judge can vote up
to five songs or less and enter the word end as a song title. Assume that the judge does
not vote for the same song more than once. To sort the array, use the selection sort
algorithm. */
