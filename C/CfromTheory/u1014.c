/* Write a program that reads two strings of less than 100 characters and removes
every occurrence of the second string inside the first one. After each removal, the remain-

characters of the second string. The program should display the first string, before it ends.
For example, if the first string is thisthat though and the second is th, the program
should display isat ough. */
