/**
 * Write a program that reads integers and stores them in a 3×5 array. The program should display the columns whose elements have different values. 
 * For example, if the array were:
 *                  1 −2 2  5 9 
 *                  3  0 2  5 1
 *                  1  7 2 −3 0
 * 
 *  the program should display the elements of the second and fifth column
