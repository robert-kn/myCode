// Practice problem 2.7

// What would be printed as a result of the following call to show_bytes? 0x616263646566

// Const char * m = “abcdef”
// show_bytes((byte_pointer) m, strlen(m));

// Note that letters ‘a’ through ‘z’ have ASCII codes 0x61 through 0x7A. 

// the library routine strlen does not count the terminating null character
