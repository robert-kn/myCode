 * Suppose you work as a truck driver, and you have been hired to carry a load of potatoes from Boise, Idaho, 
 * to Minneapolis, Minnesota, a total distance of 2,500 kilometers. You estimate you can average 100 km/hr 
 * driving within the speed limits, requiring a total of 25 hours for the trip.
 * 
 * You hear on the news that Montana has just abolished its speed limit, which constitutes 1,500 km of the trip. 
 * Your truck can travel at 150 km/hr. What will be your speedup for the trip?
 * 
 * You can buy a new turbocharger for your truck at www.fasttrucks.com. They stock a variety of models, but the 
 * faster you want to go, the more it will cost. How fast must you travel through Montana to get an overall speedup 
 * for your trip of 1.67Ã—?
