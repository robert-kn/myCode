IF WE CONSIDER THAT PART OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY WHICH MAY
NOWADAYS IN A SENSE BE REGARDED AS BONA FIDE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, WE
NOTE TWO ASPECTS WHICH HAVE A MAJOR BEARING ON THIS THEORY. THE WHOLE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE THEORY TURNS ON THE QUESTI ON OF WHETHER THERE ARE
PHYSICALLY PREFERRED STATES OF MOTION IN NATURE (PHYSICAL RELATIVITY
PROBLEM) . ALSO, CONCEPTS AND DISTINCTIONS ARE ONLY ADMISSIBLE TO THE
EXTENT THAT OBSERVABLE FACTS CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THEM WITHOUT
AMBIGUITY (STIPULATION THAT CONCEPTS AND DISTINCTIONS SHOULD HAVE
MEANING). THIS POSTULATE, PERTAINING TO EPISTEMOLOGY, PROVES TO BE OF
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE.

THESE TWO ASPECTS BECOME CLEAR WHEN APPLIED TO A SPECIAL CASE, E.G.
TO CLASSICAL MECHANICS. FIRSTLY WE SEE THAT AT ANY POINT FILLED WITH
MATTER THERE EXISTS A PREFERRED STATE OF MOTION, NAMELY THAT OF THE
SUBSTANCE AT THE POINT CONSIDERED. OUR PROBLEM STARTS HOWEVER WITH
THE QUESTION WHETHER PHYSICALLY PREFERRED STATES OF MOTION EXIST IN
REFERENCE TO EXTENSIVE REGIONS. FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF CLASSICAL
MECHANICS THE ANSWER IS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE; THE PHYSICALLY PREFERRED
STATES OF MOTION FROM THE VIEW POINT OF MECHANICS ARE THOSE OF THE
INERTIAL FRAMES.

THIS ASSERTION, IN COMMON WITH THE BASIS OF THE WHOLE OF MECHANICS AS
IT GENERALLY USED TO BE DESCRIBED BEFORE THE RELATIVITY THEORY, FAR
FROM MEETS THE ABOVE "STIPULATION OF MEANING". MOTION CAN ONLY BE
CONCEIVED AS THE RELATIVE MOTION OF BODIES . IN MECHANICS , MOTION
RELATIVE TO THE SYSTEM OF COORDINATES IS IMPLIED WHEN MERELY MOTION
IS REFERRED TO. NEVERTHELESS THIS INTERPRETATION DOES NOT COMPLY WITH
THE "STIPULATION OF MEANING" IF THE COORDINATE SYSTEM IS CONSIDERED
AS SOMETHING PURELY IMAGINARY . IF WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO EXPERIMENTAL 
PHYSICS WE SEE THAT THERE THE COORDINATE SYSTEM IS INVARIABLY REPRESENTED 
BY A "PRACTICALLY RIGID" BODY. FURTHERMORE IT IS ASSUMED THAT SUCH RIGID 
BODIES CAN BE POSITIONED IN REST RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER.
