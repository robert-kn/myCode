Purpose of the group is to bring people together who live in either Lambeth or Wandsworth so that they can have conversations, get to know each other and maybe make friends. Basically, anyone who is looking to meet new people!

With regards to events, I hope to initially organise pub meets so that people can just have a chat and get to know others. As the weather improves, I will look to add different types of events such tennis sessions at the courts in the common (tooting), hiking etc. I am very open to suggestions about events as I would like to have other people involved in helping to run the community/ hosting events.
