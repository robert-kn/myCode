Today's Internet is arguably the largest engineered system ever created by mankind, with hundreds of millions of 
connected computers, communication links, and switches.

Given that the Internet is so large and has so many diverse components and uses, is there any hope of understanding how it works? 

Are there guiding principles and structure that can provide a foundation for understanding such an amazingly large and complex system? 

And if so, is it possible that it actually could be both interesting and fun to learn about computer networks?
