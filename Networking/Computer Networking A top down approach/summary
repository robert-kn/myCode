chapter 1

1. would you agree that the internet is the largest system engineered by man?
2. give a description of the internet based on hardware and software components? 
3. what are hosts or end systems?
4. what are end systems connected by?
5. what differentiates communication links?
6. what is the transmission rate measured in?
7. what does a packet switch do?
8. what are the two most common packet switches in use today?
9. where aare link layer switches mostly used and where are routers mostly used?
10. define what a path or a route means?
11. how do end systems access the internet?
12. what are ISP's made up of?
13. what do end systems, packet switches and other pieces of equipment connected to the internet run?
14. what organisation is responsible for creating and maintaining internet standards? 
15. what are the standard documents called? 
16. are there other bodies that specify standards for network components? name one and the type of standard for a component it defines?
17. can you describe the internet from services perspective? 
18. what are the applications in the above definition referred to?
19. how does a program running one end system instruct the internet to deliver data to another program running on another end system?
20. what is the socket interface?   
21. how is a network protocol similar to a human protocol?
22. why are end systems called hosts?
23. hosts are further divided into two categories. what are they?
24. what is an access network? the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (known as the edge router)
25. name 4 different access networks?
26. what are the features of DSL an how many frequency groups does it use?
27. why are the transmission rates defined by the DSL standards said to be asymmetric?
28. are the actual downstream and upstream transmission rates aachieved by customers equal to those in DSL standards? why not?
29. name two more factors that limits the maximum transmission rate achieved using DSL?
30. what of cable, which company acts as the ISP and what communication mediums are used?
31. what does HFC stand for and where is it used?
32. what are the DOCSIS standards?
33. what does FTTH stand for and what does it entail?
34. what is the most prevalent LAN technology for connecting end systems to an edge router? 
35. what happens in a wireless LAN setting for a user to connect to the wider internet? a user connects wirelessly to an access point (base station) which is in then connected to enterprises network (likely via wired ethernet) which is then connected to the internet.
36. what is wireless LAN technology based on? IEEE 802.11 technology more colloquially known as WIFI
37. what technology do mobile devices use to share photos, videos, stream music etc? same wireless infra used For
cellular telephony to send/receive packets through a base station operated by a cellular network provider
38. what is the difference between the wifi base stations and cellular network provider base stations? a user need 
only be within a few tens of kilometers (as opposed to a few tens of meters) of the base station
39. what are the two categories that physical media (used for bit propagation) fall into? guided and unguided media
40. how do guided media operate? include coax cable, twisted pair coper wire, fibre optic cable; waves are guided along a solid medium
41. what of unguied mediums, how do they operate? the waves propagate in the atmosphere or in space such as in wireless LAN, digital channel satellite 
42. what are the characteristics of twisted pair copper wires with regards to cost, data rates? cheapest guided medium and has LAN rates of 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps
