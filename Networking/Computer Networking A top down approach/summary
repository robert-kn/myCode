34. what is the most prevalent LAN technology for connecting end systems to an edge router? 
35. what happens in a wireless LAN setting for a user to connect to the wider internet? a user connects wirelessly to an access point (base station) which is in then connected to enterprises network (likely via wired ethernet) which is then connected to the internet.
36. what is wireless LAN technology based on? IEEE 802.11 technology more colloquially known as WIFI
37. what technology do mobile devices use to share photos, videos, stream music etc? same wireless infra used For
cellular telephony to send/receive packets through a base station operated by a cellular network provider
38. what is the difference between the wifi base stations and cellular network provider base stations? a user need 
only be within a few tens of kilometers (as opposed to a few tens of meters) of the base station
39. what are the two categories that physical media (used for bit propagation) fall into? guided and unguided media
40. how do guided media operate? include coax cable, twisted pair coper wire, fibre optic cable; waves are guided along a solid medium
41. what of unguied mediums, how do they operate? the waves propagate in the atmosphere or in space such as in wireless LAN, digital channel satellite 
42. what are the characteristics of twisted pair copper wires with regards to cost, data rates? cheapest guided medium and has LAN rates of 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps 
43. how do fibre optics work? conducts pulses of light where each pulse represents a bit; immune to electromagnetic interference; very low signal attentuation
44. fibre optics are prevalent for long haul guide transmission media, why has they not been adopted for short haul guided transmission media?
because of the high costs associated with opticaal devices such as transmitters, receivers and switches
45. how do radio channels transmit signals? via the electromagnetic spectrum
46. what factors influence the transmission of a radio channel? propagation environment (interference, signal reflection) and distance over which the signal is to be characterised
47. what are the 3 categories of radio channels? those that operate over a short distance, those that operate in local areas, those that operate over a wide area
48. how does a satellite radio channel work? links two or more earth based microwaave transmitter/receiver, known as ground stations
49. how do geostationary satellites operate? remain permanently above the same spot on the earth about 36000 kilometres
50. how do low earth orbiting satellites operate? placed much closer to the earth and do not remain permanently above one spot 
51. how would you define the network core? the mesh of packet switches and links that interconnects the internet end systems
52. in network aplications, end systems exchange messages with each other. what can these messages exchanged contain? might perform a control function or
may contain data
53. what needs to be happen in order for an source end system to send data to a destination end system? the source needs to break messages into smaller chunks
54. what are these chunks called? packets
55. between source and destination, the packets travel through what? communication links and packet switches
56. what are the two pre dominant types of packet switches? routers and link layer switches
57. at what rate are packets transmitted over each communication link? at a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link
58. when it comes to packet switches, describe what is store and forward transmission? a packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin 
to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link (it must buffer the packet's bits)
59. what are the two things that each packet switch has? multiple links attached to it and output buffers for each link which store packets
that the router is aabout to send into that link
60. what must a packet do that arrives at a packet switch and finds that the link it is supposed to be transmitted onto is busy sending 
another packet? it must wait in the output buffer of the link
61. what is this phenomenon of waiting called? queuing delay
62. what do these queuing delays depend on? congestion in the network
63. is output buffer space finite or infinite?
64. what happens when a packet arrives at a packet switch and finds that the output buffer of the link it is supposed to be forwaded on is
full? the packet will get dropped or one of the queued packets will be dropped
65. how does a packet switch determine which link to send a packet onto? depends on the computer network; there are several means of 
achieving it
66. how is it implemented on the internet? each packet switch has a forwarding table that maps portions of destination addresses to the
routers outbound links
67. how do forrwarding tables get set? special routing protocols on the internet are used to automtically set the forwarding tables
68. there are two different methods of moving packets through a network of communication links and packet switches, what are they?
circuit switching and packet switching
69. how do circuit switched networks work? the resources needed along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication
between end systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems
70. are the resources reserved in packet switched networks? no, they are used on demand by a session and consequently hosts may have
to wait for access to resources
71. give an example of a network that is circuit switched? telephone network; when a person wants to initiate a phone call to another
person, the network must establish a connection between the two end systems. the switches between the end systems on the path must maintain
an active connection state during the duration of the call. this connection is called a circuit
72. does the network in question reserve a constant transmission in the networks links (representing a fraction of each links transmission
capacity)?   
73. what are the two ways you can implement a circuit in a link? frequency division multiplexing (FDM) or time division multiplexing (TDM)
74. how does FDM work? the frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established on the link i.e. the link dedicates
a frequency band to each connection for the duration of the connection
75. give two examples of systems that use FDM? telehone networks use a frequency band 4 KHz as the bandwidth; FM radio stations share the 
frequency spectrum between 88 MHz and 108 MHz with each station being allocated a specific frequency band
76. how does TDM work? in a TDM link, time is divided into frames of fixed duration and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time
slots; when the network establishes a connection across a link the network dedicates one time slot in every frame to the connection
77. for systems that use TDM, what is the transmission rate of a circuit? frame rate multiplied by the number of bits in a slot
78. what do critics of packet switching state about it? it is not suitable for real-time services such as video conference calls and phone
calls because of the end-end delays inherent in the system
79. what do proponents of packets switching state about the inherent advantages it has over circuit switching? better sharing of transmission
capacity than circuit switching; it is simpler, more efficient and less costly to implement than circuit switching 
80. what is a network of networks? where access ISPs which connect end systems and content providers to the internet are interconnected
81. what is a global transit ISP?
82. how many network structures can you think of that help to explain networks of networks? 
83. what are points of presence? a group of one or more routers at the same location in the provider's network where customer ISPs can 
connect into the providers ISP. they exist at all levels except access ISP level (the lowest tier)
84. for a customer ISP to connect to a provider ISP, what can it do? lease a high speed link from a third party telecommunication provider
to directly connect one of its routers to aa router at the POP
85. what is multi homing? when an ISP (except a tier 1 ISP) connects to two or more provider ISPs
86. what is the advantage of multi homing? if one provider ISP goes down due to a failure, the customer ISP can still receive and send 
packets from the internet
87. what does the amount that a customer ISP pays a provider ISP depend on? the amount of traffic it exchanges with the provider
88. what do nearby ISPs at the same level do in order to reduce costs relating to using the services of provider ISPs? they peer i.e. 
directly connect their networks together so that traffic between them passes over the direct connection rather than through upstream
provider ISPs
89. what does settlement free mean? when two ISPs at the same level peer then neither will pay the other party
90. what are internet exchange points (IXPs)? a meeting point created by a third party where multiple ISPs can peer together. typically
IXP are situated in a stand alone building with its own switches
91. why do content provider networks such as google or amazon attempt to bypass tier-1 ISPs (upper tier ISPs) by peering (settlement free)
with many access ISPs? to reduce payments to tier-1 ISPs and gain greater control of how their services are ultimately delivered to its
end users
92. as packet moves from end system to another end system, it suffers from nodal delay. what does nodal processing delay comprise of? 
nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and propagtion delay
93. what does processing delay entail? time required to examine a packets header and determine where to direct the packet; can also include
time needed to check for bit level errors in the packet that occured whilst transmitting them from an upstream node or router
94. what does queuing delay entail? 
95. what does transmission delay entail? is the amount of time required to push all of a packet's bit onto a link. It is calculatted using
L/R where L bits is the length of packet and R is the transmission rate of a link
96. what does propagation delay entail?
97. what does the processing delay strongly influence? the maximum throughput i.e. the maximum rate at which a router can forward packets
