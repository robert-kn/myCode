			<div>	<h1> A tribute to the man who created javascript </h1> </div>

			<div> 
				<p> Brendan Eich,an American computer programmer and technology executive, designed and released javascript 26 years ago.
				  He also co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation. Eich started work at Netscape 
				  Communications Corporation in April 1995. Eich originally joined intending to put Scheme "in the browser", but his Netscape
				  superiors insisted that the language's syntax resemble that of Java. As a result, Eich devised a language that had much of the
				  functionality of Scheme, the object-orientation of Self, and the syntax of Java. He completed the first version in ten days in order
				  to accommodate the Navigator 2.0 Beta release schedule, and called it Mocha, but renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and finally in
				  a joint announcement with Sun Microsystem it was named JavaScript in December.
