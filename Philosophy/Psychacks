1. Be the person you can love: are you enough? are you loveable? if you are, then you won't go looking for external validation in the world. You cannot solve internal problems with external solutions. Do some visualisations of what you would like to become. Take on the role of creator where your body and mind will become the mediums of the creation journey.
